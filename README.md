# BNN_active_learning_MNIST

Tensorflow Implementation of three different Bayesian Neural Networks on an Active Learning task, using the MNIST dataset. 
Models used:
1. Bayes by Backprop (based on 'Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks', C. Blundell 2015)
2. MC-Dropout (based on 'Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning', Y. Gal 2015)
3. Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (based on 'Bayesian Learning via Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics', M. Welling 2011)
